# Forensic Investigation

Every single Python file in this repository is independent of each other, unless specified in the comments.

Every file is an independent tool that can aid in basic forensics analysis, including retrieving past connected Wi-Fi networks and examining the recycle bin. 

Does NOT comply with laws regulating forensic investigation.

Thank you TJ O'Connor.
