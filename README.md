# Forensic-Investigation

Every single Python file in this repository is independent of each other, unless specified in the comments.

Every file is an independent tool that can aid in basic forensics analysis, including retrieving past connected Wi-Fi networks and examining the recycle bin. 

Thank you TJ O'Connor.
